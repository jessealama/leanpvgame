World "FirstProofs"
Title "First Proofs"

Introduction "Welcome to **World 1: First Proofs**!

In this world you will:
- Write your first verified programs in Lean 4
- Learn the core proof tactics: `simp`, `omega`, `induction`, `decide`
- Build and verify the **Euclidean GCD algorithm** from scratch
- Use your verified GCD to check primality

By the end, you'll understand what it means to formally verify a program —
and you'll have done it yourself."
